# Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Research Configuration

**IMPORTANT**: This guide is provided solely for educational and research purposes. Implementing MITM techniques without explicit authorization is illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have proper permission before using these techniques.

## Overview

This guide explains how to configure 3proxy to assist with authorized security testing and research involving MITM techniques.

## Prerequisites

- Legal authorization to perform security testing
- Basic understanding of network security principles
- 3proxy installed and configured

## Configuration

### 1. Transparent Proxy Setup

To redirect traffic through your proxy transparently:

```bash
# Enable IP forwarding
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

# Redirect HTTP traffic to local proxy
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080

# Redirect HTTPS traffic
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080
```

### 2. 3proxy Configuration for MITM

Add to your 3proxy.cfg:

```
# MITM proxy configuration
proxy -p8080 -n
# The -n flag enables DNS resolving through the proxy
```

### 3. SSL Interception

For HTTPS interception, you'll need to generate a CA certificate:

```bash
# Generate CA key and certificate
openssl genrsa -out /certs/ca.key 4096
openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key /certs/ca.key -out /certs/ca.crt -subj "/CN=Research CA"

# Configure 3proxy to use SSL plugin
plugin /plugins/SSLPlugin.so ssl_plugin
ssl_server_cert /certs/server.crt
ssl_server_key /certs/server.key
```

### 4. Traffic Analysis

To analyze traffic passing through the proxy:

```
# Enhanced logging for traffic analysis
log /logs/mitm-%y%m%d.log D
logformat "L%C - %U [%t] \"%T\" %E %I %O %N/%R:%r"
```

## Ethical Considerations

1. Never perform MITM attacks without explicit written permission
2. Document all actions taken during authorized testing
3. Do not capture sensitive data like passwords or personal information
4. Inform all participants if conducting authorized research
5. Follow responsible disclosure principles

## Legal Warning

Unauthorized interception of network traffic is illegal in most jurisdictions and may violate:
- Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (US)
- Electronic Communications Privacy Act (US)
- GDPR (EU)
- Various national and international laws

Always consult with legal counsel before conducting security research involving network interception.
